## Let's start with a monolith

<img src="images/monolith.png" style="background: transparent; border-style: none;"  />

---
## Limitations and possible issues
* itâ€™s difficult to distribute responsibility across the team members and manage release cycle as project and team size grow
* you ought to retest the entire system even if you did only a small change
* it's not possible to scale the system efficiently
* increased fragility since error in a single module might kill the entire system

---
## But the monolith is a good way to start out!

## Microservices to the rescue
<img src="images/microservices.png" style="background: transparent; border-style: none;"  />

<small>Small autonomous services that work together and modelled around a business domain</small>

---
## Benefits of the microservices
* independent release cycle of each service
* failures are isolated
* granular scaling
* freedom to choose the tech stack suitable for particular task

---
## How about challenges?
#### Welcome to <strike>hell</strike> the world of distributed systems
* everything fails all the time
* additional overhead of the remote calls
* take care of the inter-microservice contracts
* increased operational costs

***
## Minimaze the impact of failures
* don't ever use synchronous calls
* fail fast
* minimize allotted timeouts
* apply wise retry policies

---
## Synchronous calls are pure evil
A bunch of parallel synchronous calls will suddenly exhaust the thread pool

---
## Writing async code in F# is a piece of cake
    // MerchantId -> Async<MerchantDiscount>
    let getMerchantDiscount merchantId = ...
    // ProductId -> MerchantDiscount -> Async<ProductPrice>
    let getProductPrice productId discount = ...
    
    // 1st approach : async workflow
    // Async<ProductPrice>
    async {
        let! discount = getMerchantDiscount merchantId
        return! getProductPrice productId discount
    }
    // 2nd approach: more idiomatic way
    // MerchantId -> Async<ProductPrice>
    getMerchantDiscount >> Async.bind (getProductPrice productId)

---
## Why it's important to fail fast
Slow failures propagate from the dependencies up to the consumers

## Circuit breaker

---
## It's easy to adhere retries and circuit breaker with F#
    type AsyncArrow<'a,'b> = 'a -> Async<'b>
    
    // AsyncArrow<Guid, HttpResponseMessage>
    let getProductPriceFromRemoteService productId = ...

    // AsyncArrow<Guid, HttpResponseMessage> - the signature is still the same
    let execute = 
        getProductPriceFromRemoteService
        |> AsyncArrow.retry retryCount backoffStrategy
        |> AsyncArrow.circuitBreaker circuitBreakerPolicy

***
## Make failures discoverable
* collect and aggregate logs
    * don't forget about correlation ids
* collect and aggregate metrics
* monitoring

---
## Samples in F#


***
## Consumer first
* strangler pattern for evolving API
* Postel's law
* write consumer tests on the API and run them on each check in of the producer
* avoid non-explicit serialization

***
## Embrace the culture of automation
* each microservice describes its own build/deploy pipeline
    * Jenkins Pipeline + Blue Ocean plugins + Jenkinsfile
* containerization and clusterization
* dashboard for monitoring the microservices
* 

***
## Why F# is great for the microservices?

TL;DR - it reduces the overall complexity and thus simplifies your life

***
## Null is a pure evil
Try to escape from the world of nulls into the functional world of options as soon as possible

## Null checks vs options
    // Explicit null check
    let toInt (value : string) =
        if (value <> null) then
            Int32.Parse value |> Some
        else
            None
    
    // World of options
    let toInt (value : string) =
        value |> Option.ofObj |> Option.map Int32.Parse
---
## A world without null checks
* the execution flow is streamlined
* no implicit assumptions regarding the meaning of null
* no need to care about null checks

***
## Ease of domain modeling
By leveraging the algebraic data types you could easily build a rich self-describing domain model and make illegal states irrepresentable

## Example of a model

    type ContactInfo = 
    | EmailOnly of EmailContactInfo
    | PostOnly of PostalContactInfo
    | EmailAndPost of EmailContactInfo * PostalContactInfo

    type Contact = {
        Name: Name
        ContactInfo: ContactInfo
    }

***
## Rich set of compile-time checks

    type Command = 
    | Create of string
    | Deactivate    
    | Rename of string

    let handle id = function
    | Create name -> isValidName name <?> create
    | Deactivate -> isInactive id <?> deactivate
    | Rename name ->  isValidName name <?> rename

***
## Agility of the functional architecture
You can easily adjust the execution flow and address cross-cutting concerns without affecting the core domain logic as long as you get along with functional architecture

## Example

***
## A number of idiomatic patterns for modelling interservice communication
* AsyncArrow
* AsyncSeq

***
## Conclusions
* Microservices architecture give you a lot of perks but in the same time requires a decent level of expertise for the team
* F# and functional approach is great for the microservices
